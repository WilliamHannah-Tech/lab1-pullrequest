Lab 1 — Git Branching & Python Collaboration 
Objective 
The goal of this lab is to practice  team-based Git  workflows  while building a  simple, functional Python 
console application  . Emphasis is placed on  branching  discipline, collaboration, and merge 
integration  , not application complexity. 
Technical Requirements 
Repository Setup 
●  Create a  brand-new GitHub repository  from scratch  (no templates). 
●  Repository must include: 
○  README.md 
○  .gitignore  (appropriate for Python) 
○  At least one Python file (  .py  ) 
Git Workflow Requirements 
Each team member must: 
1.  Clone the repository locally 
2.  Create  their own Git branch 
○  Naming convention (recommended): 
feature/<firstname>-function 
3.  Write  at least one Python function 
4.  Commit their work to their branch 
5.  Push their branch to GitHub 
6.  Open a  Pull Request  (PR) 
7.  Participate in resolving merge conflicts (if any) 
⚠
No one should push directly to  main  except through  Pull Requests. 
Application Requirements 
●  Must be  console-based  (CLI) -  
Must execute via: 
python app.py 
●  Application purpose is  open-ended 
○  Examples: 
■  Calculator 
■  Quiz game 
■  Text-based menu 
■  File utility 
●  Must demonstrate: 
○  Function calls between files or modules 
○  Basic user input/output 
○  Clean code structure 
Deliverables 
●  GitHub repository link 
●  Evidence of: 
○  Multiple branches 
○  Multiple contributors 
○  Pull Requests 
●  Final merged working application on  main
