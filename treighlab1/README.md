Lab 1 — Git Branching & Python Collaboration

Objective

The goal of this lab is to practice team-based Git workflows while building a simple, functional Python
console application. Emphasis is placed on branching discipline, collaboration, and merge
integration, not application complexity.
Technical Requirements

Repository Setup
● Create a brand-new GitHub repository from scratch (no templates).
● Repository must include:
○ README.md
○ .gitignore (appropriate for Python)
○ At least one Python file (.py)

Git Workflow Requirements
Each team member must:
1. Clone the repository locally
2. Create their own Git branch
    ○ Naming convention (recommended):
        feature/<firstname>-function
3. Write at least one Python function
4. Commit their work to their branch
5. Push their branch to GitHub
6. Open a Pull Request (PR)
7. Participate in resolving merge conflicts (if any)

⚠️ No one should push directly to main except through Pull Requests.
